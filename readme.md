## Web user interface for the [anagram web service](https://github.com/jotrk/docker-anagram-service)

The user interface is currently a very simplistic piece of HTML and Javascript,
which uses the [autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) feature of the
jQuery user interface library. The
[index.html](https://github.com/jotrk/webui-service/blob/master/index.html) file
can be accessed over an http server, directly from disk (`file:///...`) or by
running the small http server in the package.
